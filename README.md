# Setup

1. Populate `.env` files in `apps/api-go`, `apps/web` with your own values
2. There's not much code. So I recommend to quickly review package.json files to see if you are fine with the libraries used. Then skim through the code and see if you want to change anything

TODO:

- [ ] better README
- [ ] research ways to reduce usage of React Query and rely more on server actions
- [ ] more robust error handling in web: https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/error-handling
